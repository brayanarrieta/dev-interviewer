## What inspired me to create Dev Interviewer?

I believe that each one of us has ever had to prepare for a job interview. Regardless of whether we are students, junior developers, senior developers, or a different role, we know how complicated it can be at first to enter the world of interviews. Over time, some gain experience in the process with the help of advice they receive, or, over time, they gain self-confidence to make the interviews much easier. That was the main reason that I decided to start with** Dev Interviewer** all that knowledge that everyone has can be shared with the people and help with their future interview process, and also with that, we can learn together as a community.

The main idea with **Dev Interviewer** is to share different tips and interview questions to prepare for an interview in a specific tech topic as Javascript, Node.js, Java, etc also include general tips for interview.

## Code
For now, we are using just a repository, however, in the next steps, we will separate to one for the frontend and one for the backend.

```
dev-interviewer
  --> dev-interviewer-client
  --> dev-interviewer-server
```

Everyone has a markdown guide that can be used to run the project locally.
